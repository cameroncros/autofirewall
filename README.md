autofirewall
============

This is a set of scripts and tools that can be used to automatically configure an iptables firewall to allow access to certain people to a service.

Theses scripts are not complete and are only used for our own private use. YOUR MILLAGE WILL VARY!

There is a script that allows access to certain hostnames. This lets people with static ip addresses and noip/dyndns addresses automatically gain access.

There will also be web interface to allow autentication to then let that persons ip address into the system. This is not yet added.

DONT USE THIS UNLESS YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THE CODE. OTHERWISE IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING
